# Awesome.Web

## Summary

### **Awesome.Web** is a blog site that I've built in early 2016 to brush up my web programming chops. This is more of a learning exercise than an enterprise-grade app. Still I think there are some good bits that can be plucked out of application code. Feel free to re-skin, re-launch, use-and-abuse this base code to suit your needs (no guarantees and warranties of course!). 

## Features
* Stateless-front end using a Bootstrap 3 theme.
* RESTful web service following RESTful API conventions
* Token-based authentication
* Online payment support via **PayPal** integration
* Marketing/workflow support via **Send-in-blue** integration
* Data management and persistence using MS SQL with data migrations


## Technical Sumary
This is a RESTful website. Front-end is made of AngularJS (v1.4). Back-end is Web API.
